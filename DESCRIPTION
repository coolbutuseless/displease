Description: When visualising changes between two values over time, a strict
 linear interpolation can look jarring and unnatural.  By applying a non-linear
 easing to the transition, the motion between values can appear smoother and 
 more natural.  This package includes functions for applying such non-linear
 easings to colors and numeric values, and is useful where smooth animated movement
 and transitions are desired.
